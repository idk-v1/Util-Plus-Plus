# Layout settings

# Whitespace will be ignored (Spaces and tabs)
# Each line is one element
# Values are separated by commas

# Types:
# The first character of a line is a type. Case doesn't matter.

# '#' Comment
# Ignores line.

# '?' Settings <width: int, height: int, scale: int, corner radius: int, spacing: int, font: str>
# Only the first settings will be used.

# 'S' Section <pos x: int, pos y: int, width: int, height: int, title: str, font size: int>
# Sections are designed to hold other UI elements and divide them into categories.
# Sections will be one unit taller to fit the title.

# I didn't know how to make inputs useful enough, while still having them replacable.
# My solution was having inputs run an external executable.

# 'B' Button <pos x: int, pos y: int, width: int, height: int, label: str, font size: int, exec: str>
# Buttons run <exec> when clicked.

# 'T' Toggle <pos x: int, pos y: int, width: int, height: int, label: str, font size: int, exec: str>
# Toggles also need to have a "Q_"<exec> file that will be run on startup and click.
# Toggles run <exec> when clicked, then "Q_"<exec>. "Q_"<exec> should return 1 or 0.

# 'X' Textbox <pos x: int, pos y: int, width: int, height: int, text: str, font size: int>
# Just displays text, no interaction.

# 'C': Color RRGGBB format <front: hex, background: hex, hex text: hex>
# Sets the colors of elements created after it.
